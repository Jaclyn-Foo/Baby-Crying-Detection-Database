Noisy Samples 1 - 13 are crying samples (children crying in noisy everyday environments).
Noisy Samples 14 - 16 are non-crying samples (adults speaking in noisy everyday environments).

The MS Excel file "Per Second Labelling" shows the "crying" or "non-crying" label of each one-second segment of the crying samples.
All of the one-second segments of the non-crying samples are labelled as "non-crying".

# Baby Crying Detection Database
Contains samples used for online baby crying detection algorithm testing.

There are two folders:
1. Noisy Samples - audio files of the videos extracted from YouTube
2. Custom Noisy Samples - custom audio samples made by randomly selecting and merging segments from the Noisy Samples

In each folder, the excel file "Per Second Labelling" shows the "crying" or "non-crying" label of each one-second segment of each sample.
